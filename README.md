# FAST-9 Accelerator
FAST-9 Algorithm for Corner Detection (OpenCV, C++, Verilog)

Description
----------
**FAST-9 corner detectors in C++, Verilog**

- Software

> The C ++ code used OpenCV.
> Visual Studio projects are intended to be tested in software before being implemented in hardware.

- Hardware

> The Verilog code is hardware that detects corners in an image of 180x120 size for real-time image processing.
> One pixel operates for about 20 clocks to detect corners.
> The FAST9 algorithm 3 stage was designed as a pipeline.
